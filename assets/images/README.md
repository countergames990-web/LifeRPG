# Image Assets

Please add the following image files to this directory:

1. **![alt text](open_book-1.png)** - The medieval book background image with purple/brown edges
   - Should show an open book with aged pages
   - Will be used as the main background for the book container

## How to Add:
1. Save the medieval book image as `open_book.png` in this directory
2. The app will automatically use it as the book background
